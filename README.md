## Prime Zeta Zeros
The prime zeta function is defined as the summation

$$P(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{p^s},$$

where $s=\sigma+it$ $(\sigma > 1)$ is a complex variable and $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers.

The analytical continuation of the prime zeta function in the critical strip $0<\sigma\leqslant 1$ is defined as follows:
$$\zeta_\mathbb{P}(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\log\zeta(ns),$$

where$\mu(n)$ is the MÃ¶bius function.
